## Lab Experiments

### - Experiment 1 (09-01-2025)  
In this experiment, we practiced basic image processing techniques using MATLAB:  
1. **Convert an RGB Image to Grayscale**  
2. **Extract and Display Individual Color Channels**:  
   - Red Channel  
   - Green Channel  
   - Blue Channel  

The output generated during this experiment is shown below:
