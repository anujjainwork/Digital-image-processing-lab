## Lab Experiments

### - Experiment 1 (09-01-2025)  
In this experiment, we practiced basic image processing techniques using MATLAB:  
1. **Convert an RGB Image to Grayscale**  
2. **Extract and Display Individual Color Channels**:  
   - Red Channel  
   - Green Channel  
   - Blue Channel  

The output generated during this experiment is shown below:

### - Experiment 2 (16-01-2025)  
In this experiment, we created histogram and then equalised using MATLAB:  
1. **First calculated cdf**
2. ![Histogram equalisation formula](https://github.com/anujjainwork/Digital-image-processing-lab/blob/main/histogram_equilsation/histogram_equilisation_formula.svg?raw=true)
The output generated during this experiment is shown below:
